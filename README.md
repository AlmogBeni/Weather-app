# Weather App
* This is an app to get info about the current weather at your city (or others)
* The info is being taked from OpenWeatherMap website using built in API key from there.
* You can change the variabels of the program accroding to your specifications.
* The program is written in pure Python.
* Comments are implemented all along the project to explain better what happens in each step.
* Using the VSCode extension "Better Comments", I was able to mark the comments in different colors as each step referes to different parts of the code.

* HAVE FUN!
